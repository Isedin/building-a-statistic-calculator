Now that you have the value of the input, you need to split it into an array of numbers. Use the .split() method to do this.

The .split() method takes a string and splits it into an array of strings. You can pass it a string of characters or a RegEx to use as a separator. For example, string.split(",") would split the string at each comma and return an array of strings.

Use the /,\s*/g regex to split the value string by commas. You can tweak(podesiti) it based on the number of spaces separating your values. Store the array in an array variable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The value of an input element is always a string, even if the input type is number. You need to convert this array of strings into an array of numbers. To do this, you can use the .map() method.
